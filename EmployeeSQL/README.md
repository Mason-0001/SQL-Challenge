# SQL-Challenge

For this challenge, I acted as if a company tasked me with a research project about the people they employed during the 1980s and 1990s. I used the employee databases they sent me from that period which was six CSV files and imported them into a SQL database. Lastly, I tried to answer some questions on that data. The "Employee_table_schemata" is the SQL file showing the making of the tables that I would import into and the "Employee_queries" SQL file shows the queries I made to answer certain questions.
